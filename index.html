    <h2>Summary:</h2> With 15+ years in sales and customer service, I'm trading my suit and tie for a keyboard and code editor. Currently enrolled in a web dev bootcamp, I'm eager to put my people skills to work building user-friendly, affordable software and websites that make small businesses look like big-time pros.

        Sure, I'm a newbie coder, but my eagle-eyed attention to detail and knack for problem-solving are anything but green. I'm passionate about translating my sales know-how into practical, innovative web-based solutions that delight clients and drive growth.
        
        So if you're looking for a web dev with a twist, let's chat. I may be fresh out of the bootcamp, but I'm ready to show you what this "new kid" can do.
